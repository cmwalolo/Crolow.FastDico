# A .NET implementation of a DAWG and GADDAG dictionary. 
## Ultra compact on disk and in memory.
## Ultra fast tree navigation. 

The implementations includes : 
- Dawg and GadDag Compiler
- Dawg and GadDag Word Search : 
    - Word search
    - Prefix search
    - Suffix search 
    - Wildcard search (seemless ? or *)
    - Anagram search 
    - Anagram & smaller search.
- Basic implementation of a board wordgame... To be continued or not ... or make it :-)

The code is provided as is and far less complex then other implementations. Code has been written from scratch coauthored by ChatGpt under my lead. Results from IA are not that effective. But it was a good training for both. Finally ChatGpt could totally not write the compiler, without eating minimum 100MB of memory, and could totally not optimize on disk, and in memory. But he did more or less well the Search functions, after some debugging and small fixes.
